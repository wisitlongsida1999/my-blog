Welcome to Part 3 of the **Cyber Threats Series**, where we’ll learn about **SQL Injection** attacks, how they work, and ways to stop them. 🚀

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a technique hackers use to manipulate a database by injecting malicious SQL commands through user inputs. Let’s break this down step by step to make it easy to understand! 🌟

---

## **What Is SQL? 🤔**

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage data in relational databases. Think of a database as a collection of tables like this:

| orders           | items             |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| order_number (PK)| item_id (PK)      |
| item_id (FK)     | price             |
| cost             | description       |

SQL helps applications retrieve and manage this data through **queries** like:

- **`SELECT`**: Retrieve data
- **`INSERT`**: Add new data
- **`UPDATE`**: Modify existing data

---

## **What Is SQL Injection? 🚨**

**SQL Injection (SQLi)** is a cyber attack where hackers insert malicious SQL commands into an input field to manipulate the database.

### Example:

A website login form may run this query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = 'input_username' AND password = 'input_password';
```

If a hacker enters:

```sql
' OR '1'='1
```

The query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1';
```

This always returns `TRUE`, giving the hacker unauthorized access! 😱

---

## **Types of SQL Injection Attacks 🛠️**

### 1. **Union-Based Injection 🤝**

Hackers use the **UNION** keyword to combine data from different tables.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT product_name FROM products WHERE name = 'soap' UNION SELECT username, password FROM Users;
```

This lets the hacker steal sensitive data like usernames and passwords.

---

### 2. **Error-Based Injection ❗**

Attackers force the database to display errors containing sensitive information.

#### Example:

```sql
asdf' UNION SELECT 1, exp(~(SELECT password FROM users WHERE id=1))-- -
```

This causes an error that reveals the password!

---

### 3. **Boolean-Based Injection ✅❌**

Hackers test conditions by observing **True/False** responses.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT username FROM users WHERE id = '1' AND '1'='2';
```

If `False`, no data returns. If `True`, the hacker learns more about the database structure.

---

### 4. **Time-Based Injection 🕒**

Hackers use SQL functions like `SLEEP()` to delay responses and confirm conditions.

#### Example:

```sql
' OR IF(password='admin123', SLEEP(5), NULL)-- -
```

If the response delays by 5 seconds, the hacker knows the password is correct!

---

### 5. **Out-of-Band Injection 🌐**

Rare and complex, this method uses channels like HTTP or DNS to send data to an attacker’s server.

---

## **How to Prevent SQL Injections 🛡️**

### **1. Input Sanitization 🧹**

- Remove dangerous characters like `'`, `;`, `-`.
- Example: Replace `'` with `'`.

⚠️ **Limitations**: If sanitization fails, the system is still vulnerable.

---

### **2. Use Prepared Statements 📄**

Prepared statements securely separate SQL queries from user input, making injections almost impossible.

#### Example:

In **PHP**:

```php
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("s", $username);
$stmt->execute();
```

This ensures any user input is treated as **data**, not **SQL code**.

## **Quiz Time! 🎉**

### **Q1: What type of SQL injection delays responses to confirm conditions?**

A) Error-Based Injection  
B) Boolean-Based Injection  
C) Time-Based Injection  
D) Out-of-Band Injection  

*Answer: C) Time-Based Injection*

---

### **Q2: Which is an example of input sanitization?**

A) Removing dangerous characters like `'`, `;`, and `--`  
B) Using prepared statements  
C) Cleaning sensitive user data  
D) Blocking SQL commands with firewalls  

*Answer: A) Removing dangerous characters like `'`, `;`, and `--`*

## **Conclusion 🎯**

SQL Injections are powerful and dangerous, but they’re preventable with the right techniques. By understanding how attackers exploit SQL and implementing **sanitization** and **prepared statements**, you can keep your systems secure. 💪
