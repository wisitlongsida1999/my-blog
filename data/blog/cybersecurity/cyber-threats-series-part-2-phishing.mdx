## **How to Spot Phishing 🚨**

Here are some **red flags** to watch for:

1️⃣ **Suspicious Email Address**  
Example: An email from "paypal.accounts[@]gmail[.]com" instead of **paypal.com**. 🧐

Hover over links to see where they really lead. For example, "[www.googIe.com](http://www.googie.com/)" (notice the "I" instead of "l").  

3️⃣ **Urgent Language**  
Phrases like “Act now or your account will be locked!” create panic to make you act quickly.

Legitimate companies rarely have spelling or grammar mistakes in their communications.
