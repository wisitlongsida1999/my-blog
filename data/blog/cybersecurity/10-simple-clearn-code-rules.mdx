![Clean Code Tips](/static/images/cybersecurity/10-simple-clearn-code-rules_1.png)

Clean code makes your programs easy to read, understand, and update. Follow these rules to write better code that you and others can work with easily!

---

### 1. **Use Clear and Meaningful Names**

Give variables, functions, and classes meaningful names that explain their purpose.

**❌ Bad:**

```python
a = 10
```

**✅ Good:**

```python
max_retries = 10
```

**🖍 Why?** A good name tells you what the code does without needing extra comments.

---

### 2. **Keep Functions Small and Focused**

Each function should do one thing only. If it does too many things, it gets hard to read and debug.

**❌ Bad:**

```python
def process_order(order):
    validate_order(order)
    calculate_total(order)
    apply_discount(order)
    ship_order(order)
```

**✅ Good:**

```python
def validate_order(order):
    pass

def calculate_total(order):
    pass

def apply_discount(order):
    pass
```

**🖍 Why?** Small functions are easier to understand and test.

---

### 3. **Avoid Deep Nesting**

Too many levels of nesting make code hard to follow.

**❌ Bad:**

```python
if user:
    if user.is_active:
        if order:
            process_order(order)
```

**✅ Good:**

```python
if not user or not user.is_active:
    return
if not order:
    return
process_order(order)
```

**🖍 Why?** Exiting early keeps your code simple and clear.

---

### 4. **Use Comments Wisely**

Write comments to explain "why," not "what." Good code should explain itself.

**❌ Bad:**

```python
# Set the user as active
user.is_active = True
```

**✅ Good:**

```python
# Activate the user after successful login
user.is_active = True
```

**🖍 Why?** Comments should add value by explaining reasons or business logic.

---

### 5. **Use Consistent Formatting**

Keep your code neat with consistent indentation, spacing, and alignment.

**❌ Bad:**

```python
def add(a,b):return a+b
```

**✅ Good:**

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**🖍 Why?** Neat code is easier to read and maintain.

---

### 6. **Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)**

Avoid duplicating the same code in different places.

**❌ Bad:**

```python
if user_type == "admin":
    # complex logic
if user_type == "superadmin":
    # same complex logic
```

**✅ Good:**

```python
def user_is_admin(user_type):
    return user_type in ["admin", "superadmin"]

if user_is_admin(user_type):
    # complex logic
```

**🖍 Why?** Reusing code reduces errors and makes updates easier.

---

### 7. **Follow Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

A class or function should have only one job.

**❌ Bad:**

```python
class User:
    def register(self):
        pass
    def login(self):
        pass
    def send_email(self):
        pass
```

**✅ Good:**

```python
class User:
    def register(self):
        pass
    def login(self):
        pass

class EmailService:
    def send_email(self):
        pass
```

**🖍 Why?** Breaking responsibilities into smaller parts makes your code more modular.

---

### 8. **Avoid Magic Numbers and Strings**

Use constants instead of hardcoding values directly in your code.

**❌ Bad:**

```python
discount = 0.05
if user.role == "admin":
    pass
```

**✅ Good:**

```python
DISCOUNT_RATE = 0.05
ADMIN_ROLE = "admin"

discount = DISCOUNT_RATE
if user.role == ADMIN_ROLE:
    pass
```

**🖍 Why?** Constants make your code easier to understand and change.

---

### 9. **Write Tests**

Tests make sure your code works and helps prevent bugs when making changes.

**❌ Bad:**

```python
def process_order(order):
    pass  # no tests
```

**✅ Good:**

```python
def test_process_order():
    order = create_test_order()
    result = process_order(order)
    assert result == expected_result
```

**🖍 Why?** Testing keeps your code stable and reliable.

---

### 🕟 **Keep It Simple (KISS)**

Simplicity is key. Avoid overcomplicating things.

**❌ Bad:**

```python
def add(a, b):
    if isinstance(a, int) and isinstance(b, int):
        return a + b
```

**✅ Good:**

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**🖍 Why?** Simple code is easier to read and maintain.
