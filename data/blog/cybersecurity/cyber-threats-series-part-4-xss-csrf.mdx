Welcome to Part 4 of the **Cyber Threats Series**, where we’ll explore two critical web vulnerabilities: **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** and **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**. Don’t worry, we’ll break it down to make it super easy to understand! 😊

---

## **What Is XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)? 🤔**

**XSS** happens when a web application doesn’t properly sanitize user input and sends it back to the user. Attackers exploit this to inject malicious code (usually JavaScript), which can:

- **Steal information** like cookies or session tokens. 🕵️‍♂️
- **Redirect users** to malicious websites. 🌐
- **Control the victim’s browser** to perform actions. 🚨

---

## **Types of XSS Attacks**

### **1. Stored XSS 🗄️**

Stored XSS occurs when the malicious script is **saved** on the web server, often in a database. It executes whenever users view the compromised data.

**Example:** Posting a malicious comment like:

```html
<script>alert('Hacked!');</script>
```

This script runs whenever someone views the comment.

---

### **2. Reflected XSS 🔄**

Reflected XSS involves injecting malicious code into a URL or form field. The script is "reflected" back in the server's response and executed in the user's browser.

**Example:** A crafted URL like:

```html
https://example.com/search?query=<script>alert('Hacked!');</script>
```

---

### **3. DOM-Based XSS 🖥️**

In DOM-based XSS, the attack occurs entirely on the client side. The server doesn’t directly include the malicious input in its response, but client-side scripts process and execute it.

---

## **How to Prevent XSS 🛡️**

- **Sanitize inputs:** Remove or encode dangerous characters.
- **Use libraries:** Tools like DOMPurify clean inputs automatically.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Restrict the execution of unauthorized scripts.

---

## **What Is CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)? 🤔**

**CSRF** tricks authenticated users into performing actions they didn’t intend by exploiting their active session.

---

### **How Does CSRF Work?**

1️⃣ A user logs into their account.  
2️⃣ The attacker sends a malicious link.  
3️⃣ The user's browser unknowingly performs actions using their session token.

---

## **How to Prevent CSRF 🛡️**

- **CSRF Tokens:** Use unique, dynamically generated tokens for each request.
- **Re-authentication:** Ask users to re-enter their password for critical actions.
- **Validate Referrer Headers:** Ensure requests come from trusted sources.

## **Quiz Time! 🎉**

### **Q1: What type of XSS attack stores malicious code on a server?**

A) DOM-Based XSS  
B) Reflected XSS  
C) Stored XSS  

*Answer: C) Stored XSS*

### **Q2: What is an effective way to prevent CSRF?**

A) Use JavaScript libraries.  
B) Validate session cookies.  
C) Use a CSRF token.  

*Answer: C) Use a CSRF token*

## **Key Takeaways 📝**

1️⃣ **XSS** allows attackers to run malicious scripts in users’ browsers. Prevent it with **sanitization** and **CSP**.  
2️⃣ **CSRF** tricks users into performing unintended actions. Prevent it with **CSRF tokens** and **session validation**.  

Stay tuned for the next part of the **Cyber Threats Series**! 🚀
